This is a simple text-based adventure app that will display on your command line! Will you go NORTH? Or will
you go SOUTH? The decision is yours! Will you roam around in the darkness or will you use your lantern
so that you may see where you're going? Beware... don't get eaten by a monster!

Seriously though this is a very simple app which utilizes structs and receivers to allow you to traverse a graphical
adventure based on user input. Have fun!
